# Connectivity-Testing-Tool

```
This tool is used to get local information about issues with their computer.
It provides connectivity issues to a couple of addresses you can change, aswell as RAM, diskspace, speedtest etc.

There are no services installed on purpose so it can be completely removed once the exe is deleted.

It generates the files in the temp and keeps appending the data until the customer selects export data.
Once that happens it removes all the temp data and puts it into a zip file with all the data.

This is encrypted by the encryption keys set in the project.

As it forces the end user to run a speedtest everytime opened it would need a url set in the project and
it should be a speedtestcustom.com one so you can get the results after if needed and match them against the data.
